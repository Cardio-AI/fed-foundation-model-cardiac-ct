## Abstract

Federated learning (FL) is a renowned technique for utilizing decentralized data while preserving privacy. 
    However, real-world applications often involve inherent challenges such as partially labeled datasets, where not all clients possess expert annotations of all labels of interest, leaving large portions of unlabeled data unused. %inter-observer variability, and data quality across different clients. 
    In this study, we conduct the largest federated cardiac CT imaging analysis to date, focusing on partially labeled datasets ($n=8,124$) of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) patients over eight hospital clients. %RETROSPECTIVE CLINICAL ROUTINE DATA
    Transformer architectures, which are the major building blocks of current  foundation models, have shown superior performance when trained on larger cohorts than traditional CNNs. 
    However, when trained on small task-specific labeled sample sizes, it is currently not feasible to exploit their underlying attention mechanism for improved performance. 
    Therefore, we developed a two-stage semi-supervised learning strategy that distills knowledge from several task-specific CNNs (landmark detection and segmentation of calcification) into a single transformer model by utilizing large amounts of unlabeled data typically residing unused in hospitals to mitigate these issues.
    This method not only improves the predictive accuracy and generalizability of transformer-based architectures but also facilitates the simultaneous learning of all partial labels within a single transformer model across the federation.
    Additionally, we show that our transformer-based model extracts more meaningful features for further downstream tasks than the UNet-based one by only training the last layer to also solve segmentation of coronary arteries.
    We make the code and weights of the final model openly available, which can serve as a foundation model for further research in cardiac CT imaging.

## Run Instructions

### Train Federated

With the `train_federated.py`-script multiple trainings are possible. This is determined with the `--task`-flag: 0=KD, 1=HPS, 2=MS, 3=Calcification. Training and testing can be performed on any location combination wanted with the `--locations`-flag. `num_rounds` on each client, federated `epochs`, `batch_size`, and per-client `test_ratio` can be set. The network can either be conditioned on a segmentation (`--condition_on_seg`) or the segmentation can be trained simultaneously with another head (`--output_seg`). If a SWIN-UNETR shall be used as model, the `--patches`-flag can be set out of memory requirements. A pretrained ckeckpoint can be loaded with the `--ckpt`-flag.

```
python train_federated.py \
    --task [0,1,2,3] \
    --locations [loc1, loc2, ...] \
    --mode [train, test] \
    --num_rounds 1 \
    --epochs 10 \
    --batch_size 4 \
    --test_ratio 0.2 \
    --test_on_gobal_updates \
    --test_on_local_updates \
    --exp_name federated_point_detection \
    --ckpt ckpt.pt \
    --condition_on_seg \
    --patches \
    --model_type swin_unetr
```

### Download Pretrained Checkpoints

The checkpoints will be made available upon acceptance.

### Prediction on local data

```
python tavi_predictor.py --fname ct.nii.gz --tmp_dir ./tmp
```

This will create predictions of Hinge Points, Coronary Ostias, Membranous Septum, and Calcification.

## Results

In our federation of 10 university hospitals across Germany each holds different labels that are important in cardiac CT analysis prior to TAVI.
Despite the only partially existing labels across the participating locations we were able to learn one model that can predict all.
Still, the transformer-based model (SWIN-UNETR) performs worse than a UNet with the small amounts of labelled data per label.
By using the unlabelled data in a semi-supervised fashion with knowledge distillation we are able to increase the performance of the SWIN-UNETR.

![Calcification](images/eval_calc.png)

We show that the performance of the model for predicting points is limited by the inter-observer variability between labeling locations.
Again, the SWIN-UNETR only performs on par with the federated trained UNet if the unlabeled samples are used in a semi-supervised fashion.
